    One November night in the year 1782, so the story runs, two brothers sat
    over their winter fire in the little French town of Annonay, watching the
    grey smoke-wreaths from the hearth curl up the wide chimney. Their names
    were Stephen and Joseph Montgolfier, they were papermakers by trade, and
    were noted as possessing thoughtful minds and a deep interest in all
    scientific knowledge and new discovery.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before that night—a memorable night, as it was to prove—hundreds of millions
    of people had watched the rising smoke-wreaths of their fires without
    drawing any special inspiration from the fact.
