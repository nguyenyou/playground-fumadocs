<div class="box">
  <p>
    One November night in the year 1782, so the story runs, two brothers sat
    over their winter fire in the little French town of Annonay, watching the
    grey smoke-wreaths from the hearth curl up the wide chimney.

</div>
<p>
  Their names were Stephen and Joseph Montgolfier. They were papermakers by
  trade, and were noted as possessing thoughtful minds and a deep interest in
  all scientific knowledge and new discovery.
</p>
<p>
  Before that night—a memorable night, as it was to prove—hundreds of millions
  of people had watched the rising smoke-wreaths of their fires without drawing
  any special inspiration from the fact.
