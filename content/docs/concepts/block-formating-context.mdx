title: Block formatting context
description: Block formatting context
---

A block formatting context (BFC) is a part of a visual CSS rendering of a web page. It's the region in which the layout of block boxes occurs and in which floats interact with other elements.

A block formatting context is created by at least one of the following:

- The root element of the document (`<html>`).
- Floats (elements where float isn't `none`).
- Absolutely positioned elements (elements where position is `absolute` or `fixed`).
- Inline-blocks (elements with display: inline-block).
- Table cells (elements with display: table-cell, which is the default for HTML table cells).
- Table captions (elements with display: table-caption, which is the default for HTML table captions).
- Anonymous table cells implicitly created by the elements with display: table, table-row, table-row-group, table-header-group, table-footer-group (which is the default for HTML tables, table rows, table bodies, table headers, and table footers, respectively), or inline-table.
- Block elements where overflow has a value other than visible and clip.
- Elements with display: flow-root.
- `<button>` elements and button `<input>` types defaulting to display: flow-root.
- Elements with contain: layout, content, or paint.
- Flex items (direct children of the element with display: flex or inline-flex) if they are neither flex nor grid nor table containers themselves.
- Grid items (direct children of the element with display: grid or inline-grid) if they are neither flex nor grid nor table containers themselves.
- Multicol containers (elements where column-count or column-width isn't auto, including elements with column-count: 1).
- column-span: all, even when the column-span: all element isn't contained by a multicol container.

Formatting contexts affect layout because an element that establishes a new block formatting context will:
- contain internal floats.
- exclude external floats.
- suppress margin collapsing.

Flex and grid containers, defined by setting an element's (display to flex, grid, inline-flex, or inline-grid), establishes a new flex or grid formatting context. These are similar to block formatting context except there are no floating children available inside a flex or grid container, but these formatting contexts do exclude external floats and suppress margin collapsing.
