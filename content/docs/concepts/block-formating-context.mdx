Block Formatting Context (BFC) is one of those foundational CSS concepts that every engineer should deeply understandâ€”it's the invisible layout mechanism that governs how block-level elements behave and interact with each other.

## What is a BFC?

A BFC is an isolated rendering region where block-level boxes are laid out according to specific rules. Think of it as a "container" that establishes its own layout context, separate from the rest of the document flow. Elements inside a BFC don't affect elements outside it, and vice versa.

## How to create a BFC?

Several CSS properties trigger BFC creation:

Most common triggers:

- overflow: hidden (or any value except visible)
- display: flow-root (the modern, semantic way)
- display: flex or display: grid (on the container)
- position: absolute or position: fixed
- float: left or float: right
